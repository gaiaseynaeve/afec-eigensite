Hi there, my name is Ga√Øa Seynaeve and I am a **25 year old student** in Graphic and Digital Media (Grafisch en Digitale Media) at AP Hogeschool. Before starting these studies I successfully graduated from a **bachelor in international business**. I wanted to keep studying as I was not done learning and I wanted to do something with my creativity, something more hands on. This is how I acquired quite a lot of knowledge about different aspects.

If I had to describe my design style, I would choose for a minimalistic style with earthy tones.

I am creative and I love coming with nice but simple new ideas. I also have a very **international mind**. After graduating from high school I went on a gap year in Valencia, Spain and Vancouver, Canada. This taught me to be very **independent** en learning about different cultures.

Furthermore, I have been working since I was 15 years old. For most of the time I worked for the jewelry brand Twice as Nice. I worked in different departments there, including the marketing department.
For my internship in my last year of my previous bachelor, I worked in the marketing department of the big company BRP France, they own the brands Sea-Doo, Can-Am, and so on.

To finish, at home I speak French, I always have been at school in Dutch and I did my previous bachelor degree entirely in English. Hence, I can say I am perfectly **trilingual**. I also have a good knowledge of Spanish and German.

**Curious to see my cv?**
