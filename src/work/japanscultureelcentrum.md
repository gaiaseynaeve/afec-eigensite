As our internship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 situation, we got as an assignment to choose an association without lucrative purpose and see where they need help with their brand graphically. My group and I worked wit a Japanese cultural centre here in Belgium. The owner of the centre wanted to have a whole new branding, so that is what we did.
